# Clocks! 
I made this project to try my hand at time related programming, I also got to experiment 
with keyboard events and learned more about the useEffect hook. **_Really proud of the design of this one, btw_**

## Stopwatch
The stopwatch has a laps feature, which basically means you can divide the total time 
since the clock has started into **different segments**, this feature is really useful
in repeated activities with little time variation, like running a certain distance or
checking out how fast you can peel potatoes.

## Timer
I mean its just a timer, I will say though, setting the time with the keyboard feels pretty great.


## Links
* [React](https://es.reactjs.org/). JS library used.
* [React-router-dom](https://v5.reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start). Library used for SPA navigation.

* I did not use a CSS framework, I really missed tailwind so next time I might go for it.
